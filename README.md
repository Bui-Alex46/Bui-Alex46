# **Full Stack Engineer** 

📍  Orange County, CA | 🏫 California State University, Fullerton (Dec. 2024) | 📧 alex46bui@gmail.com

I may appear as your typical tech student studying for a degree in Computer Science, but more importantly, I am a full stack web developer. I have dealt with many hands-on projects related to web development and utilizing tools such as **React**, **HTML**, **CSS** **Javascript**, **PostgreSQL** and much more! On my free time I like to train and maintain my fitness as well as play around with different software to design stunning web applications. I have a true passion for building and problem-solving. Alongside my academics, I supplement my education with challenging side projects and independent research. My goal is to one day build a startup software company of my own.
