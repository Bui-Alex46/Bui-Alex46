## 👋 Hi there, I'm Alex!

# **Full Stack Engineer** 

📍  Orange County, CA | 🏫 California State University, Fullerton (Dec. 2024) | 📧 alex46bui@gmail.com

I may appear as your typical tech student studying for a 4-year degree in Computer Science, but more importantly, I am a full stack web developer. On my free time I like to train at the gym and play around with different software to design stunning websites and web applications. I supplement my education with challenging side projects, and my goal is to one day build a software company of my own.
